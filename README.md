## COIL100
COIL100 dataset consists of 7,200 images including 100 categories of objects. In this experiment, the images were converted to gray level with size of 32×32.

## USPS
The United States Postal Service(USPS) [61] database consists of 1,100 of each handwritten digit (0~9). The images in this database are resized to 16 × 16 pixels.

## ICADAR2003
The ICADAR2003 robust reading dataset was collected for the robust reading competition of scene text detection and recognition. The scene character dataset ICDAR03-CH contains more than 11,500 character images. It is a very difficult dataset because of serious non-text background outliers with the cropped character samples, and many character images have very low resolutions. There are 6,185 training characters and 5,430 testing characters, respectively. Following the evaluation protocols of literature [62], [63], the characters that do not belong to the 62 classes (52 upper and lower case English letters plus 10 digits) were excluded and then 6,113 characters were left for training while 5,379 characters were left for testing.

## CMU PIE
The CMU PIE face database [67] contains 68 individuals with 41,368 face images as a whole. The face images are captured in various poses, illuminations, and expressions. In our experiments, we selected a subset (C29), which contains 1,632 images from 68 individuals (each providing 24 images). The C29 subset involves variations in illumination, facial expression and pose. All the face images were automatically aligned based on eye coordinates and cropped to 32 × 32 pixels.
